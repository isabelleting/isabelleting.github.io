# Lei's Portfolio

## Description 

A portfolio project with MIT xPro to showcase what we’ve done in these first 10 weeks and all of the skills we’ve learned so far. 

## How To Run

After loading in a browser window:
*From the nav bar the Home page includes everything about me
*The My Projects page includes links to all my project repos
*The Contact Me link will take you to LinkedIn for contact purposes. 

## Future Roadmap

As I learn I would like to polish this portfolio while adding more projects, and update the styling as I go on.
